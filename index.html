<h1><strong>Hello and welcome to voxelstice.github.io</strong></h1>
<p>This is just a slightly obsolete site, but it has a bit of stuff. So go ahead and take a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>My Minecraft Mods</h1>
<p>Some of them are just silly or only made for fun. I don't really do a lot of mods. Simply click on a version number to download the specified version. Installation is just like how you install any forge mod to your minecraft client. If you find any issues, report it to the issues tab from the mod's github page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crash Mod 1.0 <a href="https://voxelstice.github.io/files/crashmod/crashmod-1.0-1.7.10.jar">(1.7.10)</a> <a href="https://voxelstice.github.io/files/crashmod/crashmod-1.0-1.12.2.jar">(1.12.2)</a> <a title="https://github.com/Voxelstice/CrashMod" href="https://github.com/Voxelstice/CrashMod/tree/1.12.2">(Source code)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>No these aren't gonna be on curseforge. Atleast until I can get an account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>uhh im just a programmer that is just bored of almost everything. this is all you get for an about me page.</p>
<p>i can code in JavaScript, Java, Lua, and C#.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Anything else?</h1>
<p>Well aside from everything you see from the above, I just did random html embed foolery. So if you ever notice the amount of .jpg folders and get confused, this is why.</p>
